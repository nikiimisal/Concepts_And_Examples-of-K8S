# POD 


### What is a Pod in Kubernetes? 🧩


A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.<br>
It represents one or more containers that run together on the same node and share:


- 🧠 Network (same IP & port space)
- 💾 Storage (volumes)
- ⚙️ Configuration (environment, secrets)


👉 In simple words:<br>
Pod = Wrapper around container(s)

## There Are 8 Types of Pods

###  1️⃣ Pod 

Pod Creation – Manifest File 

When we create a Pod, we must write a YAML file.
From here onward, any YAML file used to create Kubernetes resources is called a Manifestation (Manifest) File.

4 Important Parts of a Manifest File :

1️⃣ apiVersion
➡️ Defines which Kubernetes API version is used to create the object.

2️⃣ kind
➡️ Specifies what type of object you are creating (Pod, Deployment, Service, etc.).

3️⃣ metadata
➡️ Stores basic information like Pod name, labels, and namespace.

4️⃣ spec
➡️ Contains the actual configuration of the Pod, such as container image, ports, and volumes.


Example :

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: first-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yml         # create a pod using yaml file with using this command
kubectl get pods                 # Check if Pod is created
```

key points :

- The smallest unit in Kubernetes
- A Pod can run one or more containers
- Containers in a Pod share network, storage, and configuration


Example:
Running a single Nginx container



>  👉 A Kubernetes manifest file always has apiVersion, kind, metadata, and spec, which define what to create and how to run it.
